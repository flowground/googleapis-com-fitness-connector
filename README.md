## API Description

Stores and accesses user data in the fitness store from apps on any platform.

## Authorization

Supported authorization schemes:
- OAuth2

For OAuth 2.0 you need to specify OAuth Client credentials as environment variables in the connector repository:
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` - your OAuth client id
* `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` - your OAuth client secret

## Actions

### Lists all data sources that are visible to the developer, using the OAuth scopes provided. The list is not exhaustive; the user may have private data sources that are only visible to other developers, or calls using other scopes.

*Tags:* `users`

#### Input Parameters
* `dataTypeName` - _optional_ - The names of data types to include in the list. If not specified, all data sources will be returned.
* `userId` - _required_ - List data sources for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.
* `key` - _optional_ - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.
* `oauth_token` - _optional_ - OAuth 2.0 token for the current user.
* `prettyPrint` - _optional_ - Returns response with indentations and line breaks.
* `quotaUser` - _optional_ - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
* `userIp` - _optional_ - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.

### Creates a new data source that is unique across all data sources belonging to this user. The data stream ID field can be omitted and will be generated by the server with the correct format. The data stream ID is an ordered combination of some fields from the data source. In addition to the data source fields reflected into the data source ID, the developer project number that is authenticated when creating the data source is included. This developer project number is obfuscated when read by any other developer reading public data types.

### Performs an inclusive delete of all data points whose start and end times have any overlap with the time range specified by the dataset ID. For most data types, the entire data point will be deleted. For data types where the time span represents a consistent value (such as com.google.activity.segment), and a data point straddles either end point of the dataset, only the overlapping portion of the data point will be deleted.

*Tags:* `users`

#### Input Parameters
* `currentTimeMillis` - _optional_ - The client's current time in milliseconds since epoch.
* `dataSourceId` - _required_ - The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset.
* `datasetId` - _required_ - Dataset identifier that is a composite of the minimum data point start time and maximum data point end time represented as nanoseconds from the epoch. The ID is formatted like: "startTime-endTime" where startTime and endTime are 64 bit integers.
* `modifiedTimeMillis` - _optional_ - When the operation was performed on the client.
* `userId` - _required_ - Delete a dataset for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.
* `quotaUser` - _optional_ - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.
* `userIp` - _optional_ - Deprecated. Please use quotaUser instead.

### Returns a dataset containing all data points whose start and end times overlap with the specified range of the dataset minimum start time and maximum end time. Specifically, any data point whose start time is less than or equal to the dataset end time and whose end time is greater than or equal to the dataset start time.

*Tags:* `users`

#### Input Parameters
* `dataSourceId` - _required_ - The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset.

* `pageToken` - _optional_ - The continuation token, which is used to page through large datasets. To get the next page of a dataset, set this parameter to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. Each subsequent call will yield a partial dataset with data point end timestamps that are strictly smaller than those in the previous partial response.
* `userId` - _required_ - Retrieve a dataset for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.
* `quotaUser` - _optional_ - An opaque string that represents a user for quota purposes. Must not exceed 40 characters.

*Tags:* `users`

#### Input Parameters
* `currentTimeMillis` - _optional_ - The client's current time in milliseconds since epoch. Note that the minStartTimeNs and maxEndTimeNs properties in the request body are in nanoseconds instead of milliseconds.
* `dataSourceId` - _required_ - The data stream ID of the data source that created the dataset.
* `datasetId` - _required_ - Dataset identifier that is a composite of the minimum data point start time and maximum data point end time represented as nanoseconds from the epoch. The ID is formatted like: "startTime-endTime" where startTime and endTime are 64 bit integers.
* `userId` - _required_ - Patch a dataset for the person identified. Use me to indicate the authenticated user. Only me is supported at this time.

### Aggregates data of a certain type or stream into buckets divided by a given type of boundary. Multiple data sets of multiple types and from multiple sources can be aggreated into exactly one bucket type per request.

*Tags:* `users`

#### Input Parameters

* `fields` - _optional_ - Selector specifying which fields to include in a partial response.
* `key` - _optional_ - API key. Your API key identifies your project and provides you with API access, quota, and reports. Required unless you provide an OAuth 2.0 token.

#### Input Parameters
* `endTime` - _optional_ - An RFC3339 timestamp. Only sessions ending between the start and end times will be included in the response.

* `pageToken` - _optional_ - The continuation token, which is used for incremental syncing. To get the next batch of changes, set this parameter to the value of nextPageToken from the previous response. This token is treated as a timestamp (in millis since epoch). If specified, the API returns sessions modified since this time. The page token is ignored if either start or end time is specified. If none of start time, end time, and the page token is specified, sessions modified in the last 30 days are returned.
